# **Predicting CO₂ Emissions Using Regression Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project applies **regression analysis** to predict **CO₂ emissions** from vehicles based on relevant features. By leveraging statistical modeling, we aim to uncover key patterns influencing emission levels and develop a reliable predictive framework.  

## **Dataset**  
We use the **CO₂ Emission by Vehicles dataset** from Kaggle:  
[CO₂ Emission by Vehicles Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles/data)  

The dataset contains detailed records of vehicle **fuel consumption, engine specifications, and CO₂ emission levels**, providing valuable insights into factors affecting emissions.  

## **Objective**  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on vehicle emissions data.  
- Build and evaluate a **regression model** to predict CO₂ emissions.  
- Identify the most influential variables affecting emission rates.  

## **Tools & Libraries**  
This project makes use of the following technologies:  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and visualization  
- **Regression models** (Linear Regression, Multiple Regression)  

## **Key Findings**  
- **Fuel consumption** and **engine size** strongly correlate with CO₂ emissions.  
- Certain vehicle types significantly impact emission levels.  
- Regression models demonstrate reliable predictive capabilities.
